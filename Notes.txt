Notes:

-Go back over and do much more detailed comments. Make it clear that you chose ArrayList implementation instead of queue
so that you could shuffle easier 

-The reason that you cannot create a full deck was that your Deck constructor creates a deck, but its variables are 
private...you need to set the deck field
